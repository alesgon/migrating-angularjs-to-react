        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          ReactJS is an amazing View library that promises (and delivers) high performance, composability, and maintainability. AngularJS is an amazing MV* framework.
          Tons of shops have adopted and totally bought into AngularJS for their entire frontend application. They're loving it, but some are finding that as these applications get bigger, they can become unwieldy, unperformant, and difficult to reason about. Many of these problems can be solved by doing things better with angular, but not all of them.
          In this talk, we'll go over why you don't need to re-write your whole application to get some of the wins of React and that it actually is quite easy to integrate the two. We'll talk about where it makes sense to bring in React to an existing Angular codebase and how it works well.
